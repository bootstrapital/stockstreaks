    <h1>Discover Streaks (Placeholder)</h1>
    <p>This page is a placeholder for future functionality, such as more extensive lists of notable streaks or a potential stock screener based on streak criteria. [cite: 11, 99]</p>
    
    <p>For now, please check the "Notable Market Streaks" section on the <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Homepage</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Future Ideas:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Filter stocks by current streak length (winning or losing).</li>
        <li>Identify stocks ending long streaks.</li>
        <li>Find stocks starting new streaks after a period of consolidation.</li>
        <li>Historical analysis of streak performance for specific tickers.</li>
    </ul>
