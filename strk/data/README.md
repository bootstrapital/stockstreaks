# /data Directory
This directory contains the JSON data files generated by the `pipeline/run_pipeline.py` script.
The Flask application reads from these files to display information.

- `market_indices.json`: Data for the Market Snapshot section on the Home Page.
- `notable_streaks.json`: Data for the Notable Market Streaks section on the Home Page.
- `tickers/`: Contains individual JSON files for each stock symbol (e.g., `AAPL.json`).
